Code blocks must be indented by 4 whitespaces.
Python-Markdown has a auto-guess function which works
pretty well:

    print("Hello, World")
    # some comment
    for letter in "this is a test":
        print(letter)

In cases where Python-Markdown has problems figuring out which
programming language we use, we can also add the language-tag
explicitly. One way to do this would be done.
