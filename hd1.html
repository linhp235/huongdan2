<h2>This is a test</h2>

<h3>Success</h3>

<p>Code blocks must be indented by 4 whitespaces.
Python-Markdown has a auto-guess function which works
pretty well:</p>

<pre><code>print(&quot;Hello, World&quot;)
# some comment
for letter in &quot;this is a test&quot;:
    print(letter)
</code></pre>

<p>In cases where Python-Markdown has problems figuring out which
programming language we use, we can also add the language-tag
explicitly. One way to do this would be done.</p>
